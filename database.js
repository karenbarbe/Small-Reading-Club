Placing her sister’s death in the context of the femicide crisis in Mexico, Rivera Garza documents and recreates the years and months leading up to her murder, interweaving startling facts, case files and newspaper accounts with lyrical meditations on her family life and Liliana’s efforts to break away from her obsessive high school boyfriend. The excerpts from Liliana’s teenage diary and her oft-repeated desire not to be left alone haunt the narrative, as do Rivera Garza’s guilt and shame over her sister’s death.',
